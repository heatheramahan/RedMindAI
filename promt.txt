Project Goal:  
Develop an Offensive AI Pentester tool for Red Teamers, focused on web application security testing.

Initial Stage Tasks:
Implement functionality to detect static vulnerabilities in JavaScript files.
Allow users to either:
Upload JavaScript files directly, or
Provide an endpoint (e.g., http://target.com/dummya.js) for scanning.
The agent should analyze the files for potential security weaknesses and vulnerabilities, including:
Client-side attacks (UI-related issues)
Critical functions that may expose sensitive operations
Agent Development:
Use the Agent Development Kit (ADK) documentation to build the agent.
The agent will follow a provided instruction set, which defines the process for identifying vulnerabilities.
Instructions include:
Reviewing each function in the JavaScript file
Checking for functions that can be executed without authentication
Identifying risks such as:
Unauthorized data access
Account takeover
Login bypass
Technology Stack:
Backend: Python (for agent implementation)
Frontend: React.js  (for user interface)

Second Task:  
The agent should be capable of detecting Broken Access Control vulnerabilities across the web application.
Example: Verify whether admin-level functionality is accessible to a low-privilege user.
The agent should test scenarios where:
An admin authorization token/cookie is compared against a low-privilege user’s token/cookie.
If any functionality or resource intended only for admin users is accessible with a low-privilege token/cookie, the agent must flag this as a vulnerability.
Implementation Notes:
Use the Agent Development Kit (ADK) to build the agent.
The agent should automate:
Validation of authorization tokens/cookies.
Detection of unauthorized access attempts.
Reporting of any endpoints or actions that bypass proper access control.

Third Task:  
The agent should be capable of detecting Injection Attacks within the web application.

Types of injection vulnerabilities to check include:

SQL Injection

HTML Injection

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Code Injection

Command Injection

The agent must support testing across multiple HTTP request methods, including:

POST

GET

TRACE

UPDATE

PUT

Input fields should be used to accept and process these requests for vulnerability testing.

Use the Agent Development Kit (ADK) to build the agent and automate detection.

Fourth Task:  
Create a centralized chat interface (similar to a chatbot) that integrates all the above tasks.

The chat should serve as a single entry point for checking web application vulnerabilities.

It must provide:

Centralized access to all scanning tasks.

Separate features for each specific task (e.g., static analysis, broken access control, injection attacks).

The chatbot should allow users to interact naturally while the agent executes the appropriate vulnerability checks in the background.
