Develop an Offensive AI Pentester Tool for Red Teamers, designed to emulate the mindset of a human hacker or security researcher, with a focus on web application security testing.

🚀 Initial Stage Tasks
Task 1: Static Vulnerability Detection in JavaScript
Detect static vulnerabilities in JavaScript files.

Input options:

File Upload (users upload JS,TXT, jsp, tps, .ts etc files).

Endpoint Scan (e.g., http://target.com/dummya.js).

Analyze files for:

Client-side attacks (UI-related issues).

Critical functions exposing sensitive operations.

Agent Development Notes:

Use Agent Development Kit (ADK).

Instruction set includes:

Review each function.

Check for unauthenticated execution.

Identify risks: unauthorized data access, account takeover, login bypass.

Technology Stack:

Backend: Python

Frontend: React.js

Task 2: Broken Access Control Detection:

Detect Broken Access Control vulnerabilities. if researcher giving 100_ API's Endpoint and want to test broken access control vulnerabilities want to verify whether normal user able to access the admin endpoint through out all the endpoints
Flag vulnerabilities without authentication any after login API enpoint is accessible.

Example: Verify if admin functionality is accessible to low-privilege users.
Compare admin tokens/cookies vs low-privilege tokens/cookies.
Flag vulnerabilities if restricted functionality is accessible  to low privilege user. 

Implementation Notes:
Use ADK.
Automate:
Token/cookie validation.
Unauthorized access detection.
Endpoint reporting.


Task 3: Injection Attack Detection
Detect Injection Attacks:

SQL Injection , Blind, Time based, Boolean Based. etc

HTML Injection

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Code Injection

Command Injection

Request Methods Supported:

POST, GET, TRACE, UPDATE, PUT

Implementation Notes:

Input fields should accept and process these request types.

Use ADK to automate detection and reporting.

Task 4: Centralized Chat Interface
Create a chatbot-style interface that integrates all tasks.

Features:

Single entry point for vulnerability testing.

Separate modules for each task.

Natural user interaction while agent executes checks in the background.

🔮 Future Enhancements
Dynamic Analysis:

Simulate real-world attack scenarios.

Execute payloads dynamically against live endpoints.

Detect runtime vulnerabilities beyond static code analysis.

Advanced Reporting:

Generate detailed vulnerability reports (PDF/HTML).

Include severity ratings, exploitability, and remediation guidance.

Integration with Security Frameworks:

Align findings with MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems).

Map vulnerabilities to OWASP Top 10 categories.

Ensure compatibility with practical web app pentest methodologies.

Burp Suite Integration:

Accept HTTP requests/responses directly from Burp Suite.

Analyze them for vulnerabilities using a human-like red team approach.

Provide insights similar to how a skilled pentester would manually test.

Expanded Dynamic Testing:

Detect logic flaws, privilege escalation, and chained exploits.

Support fuzzing and automated payload generation.

Fifth Task: Diagram & Image-Based Vulnerability Analysis
The agent should be capable of analyzing uploaded diagrams and images (e.g., dataflow diagrams, network diagrams, architecture charts) to identify potential dynamic vulnerabilities.

Objectives:

Accept uploads of diagrams/images (e.g., .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .svg, .pdf).

Interpret the diagram structure to understand:

Data flows between components.

Trust boundaries (internal vs external zones).

Network architecture (servers, firewalls, endpoints, APIs).

Apply reasoning like a human hacker/red teamer to detect:

Missing or weak authentication between components.

Unencrypted communication channels.

Exposed admin interfaces.

Misconfigured firewalls or open ports.

Potential privilege escalation paths.

Cross-check diagram findings with dynamic analysis logic (e.g., if a Burp Suite HTTP request/response is provided, correlate it with the diagram to find exploitable flows).

Implementation Notes:

Use the Agent Development Kit (ADK) for agent logic.

Backend (Python):

Use OCR/diagram parsing libraries (OpenCV, Tesseract, networkx) to extract nodes, flows, and labels.

Apply vulnerability reasoning rules (similar to STRIDE/OWASP threat modeling).

Frontend (React.js):

Upload interface for diagrams.

Visualization of detected vulnerabilities mapped onto the diagram.

Expected Outcome:

The agent should think like a red teamer when reviewing diagrams.

If a target.com  dataflow diagram or network diagram is uploaded, the agent should highlight possible vulnerabilities (e.g., “Unencrypted traffic between web server and database”, “Admin panel exposed to public network”).

When combined with Burp Suite HTTP requests/responses, the agent should correlate diagram insights with live traffic to uncover real exploitable paths.
